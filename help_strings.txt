sequ_description = sequ - print a sequence of numbers
format_help = Use printf style floating-point FORMAT
pad_help = Equalize width by padding with PAD. STRING must be a single character long
pad_spaces_help = Equalize width by padding with spaces. Equivalent to "-p ' '"
equal_width_help = Equalize width by padding with leading zeroes. Equivalent to "-p '0'"
separator_help = Use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)
words_help = Ouput the sequence as a single, space-separated, line. Equivalent to "-s ' '"
numbers_help = Takes up to 3 arguments FIRST INCREMENT LAST. Must be integers and/or floats.
format_word_help = Will format the output according to FORMAT_WORD. arabic = Integers. float = Floating point numbers. roman/ROMAN = Roman numerals (lower-case or upper-case). alpha/ALPHA = Letters (lower-case or upper-case). Roman numerals must be between 1 and 3999. They can be entered either as integers or as numerals, but they must be properly formatted (IE: IIII is not valid, you would have to use IV). Letters must be between 'a/A' and 'z/Z' This means the largest output in alpha mode is 26 (a-z).
number_lines_help = Number the lines of the given file, and output the result on standard output. END cannot be given with this mode. Additionally, the file must be 26 or less lines long if the format-word is alpha, and less than 4000 lines long if the format-word is roman.
post_help = Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT. linesep  linesep If FIRST or INCREMENT is omitted, it defaults to 1. That is, an omitted linesep INCREMENT defaults to 1 even when LAST is smaller than FIRST. FIRST, INCREMENT linesep and LAST are interpreted as floating point values. INCREMENT is usually linesep positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and INCREMENT is usually negative if linesep FIRST is greater than LAST. FORMAT must be suitable for printing one argument linesep of type 'double'; it defaults to %.PRECf if FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are all linesep fixed point decimal numbers with maximum precision PREC, and to %g otherwise. linesep  linesep Author linesep   Written by Casey English. linesep  linesep Reporting Bugs linesep   Report bugs to cenglish@cs.pdx.edu linesep  linesep Copyright linesep   Copyright (c) 2013 Casey English.
